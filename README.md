# MutualFinder
Simple userplugin made for [Vencord](https://vencord.dev) that displays all mutuals in the current discord server you are viewing.

## üì• Installation

Install MutualFinder using git clone (Assuming /Vencord/src is already present but ../userplugins is not)

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/randomguy6407/MutualFinder.git
  vcpath=$(find ~ -type d -path "*/Vencord/src" -print -quit)
  mkdir -p "$vcpath/userplugins"
  cp -r MutualFinder "$vcpath/userplugins"

  

```
    
## üõ†Ô∏è Building Vencord from base
As Vencord requires users to manually build the source from scratch and inject it into Discord, it requires you to download Vencord from the source.

## ‚ùì FAQ 

## ü§î Why did i build this?
I was actually particularly interested in what servers my friends are inside together with me, and i figured that it would take too much time and effort to individually hand check each server. So I decided to build this userplugin for [Vencord](https://vencord.dev) to automatically scan your entire friend list in your current focused server for mutual friends in that specific server.

## ü§î What technical difficulties did you face?
During the making of this userplugin, i faced a technical limitation with discord's internal stores where GuildMemberStore.getMemberIds only returns a small list of members in the current focused server. This means that in a very large server with tens or even hundreds of thousands of members, GuildMemberStore.getMemberIds would only return a handful of members, which makes the userplugin ineffective. To circumvent this, i went to read the documentation of a discord self-bot API called [Discord-S.C.U.M](https://github.com/Merubokkusu/Discord-S.C.U.M), there i found that i could craft raw API calls to discord for each friend to retrieve their [profile](https://github.com/Merubokkusu/Discord-S.C.U.M/blob/master/docs/using/REST_Actions.md) which returns their mutual_guilds to cross refer with the current focused server which makes my userplugin effective.
